Welcome! This is the official Github of the Auxilium bot for Discord. This bot is and will likely always be WIP. As long as I (or you guys!) have ideas, I will continue to add to the bot.

Auxilium is a multi-purpose Discord bot that makes your life easier. It provides everything from server management, to user management, to full logging of bans/kicks/joins/etc... And everything else you would want in a server management bot!

Full command list found on the [Site (WIP).]()
